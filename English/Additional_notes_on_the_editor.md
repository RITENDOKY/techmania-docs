* The preview button in the bottom bar is always grayed out. This is a placeholder for a feature to be added in a future version.
* The editor will always leave at least 1 empty scan at the end of the pattern. If you place a note in the last scan, a new scan will be added. However, removing all notes from the last scan will not delete that scan; close and re-open a pattern to delete excessive empty scans.
